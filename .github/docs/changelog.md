## 2026-05-01

| Scope   | Change                                                                                                                                          |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Docs    | Rewrote `PLAN.md` as a thin tracker that defers to `.github/docs/` and the GitHub issues; replaced stale pre-redesign content                   |
| Tooling | Created `.claude/skills/tdd-permanent-fn/SKILL.md` — scaffolds Tier-1 testthat files for permanent functions per arch-03 / arch-02.01           |
| Tooling | Created `.claude/skills/cleanup-batch/SKILL.md` — executes one numbered cleanup batch from arch-01 with pre-flight, tests, check, smoke-test    |
| Tooling | Created `.claude/skills/roxygen-document/SKILL.md` — adds/upgrades roxygen2 per the rules file with template selection and example verification |
| Tooling | Created `.claude/skills/issue-progress-comment/SKILL.md` — drafts confirmation-gated progress comments for #8/#10/#11/#12/#13                   |
| Tooling | Created `.claude/agents/r-package-reviewer.md` sub-agent for read-only diff review of NAMESPACE, roxygen, debug artefacts, and R CMD check      |
| Tooling | Created `.claude/hooks/auto-changelog.sh` Stop hook that auto-drafts changelog rows from the uncommitted diff and is idempotent across reruns   |
| Tooling | Created `.claude/settings.json` to register the auto-changelog Stop hook for both collaborators                                                 |
| Tooling | Updated `.claude/CLAUDE.md` to document the new integration branch (`koichi-arch-redesign`), the skills/sub-agent table, and the hook behaviour |
| Config  | Added `.claude/` and `PLAN.md` to `.Rbuildignore` so they don't ship with the package build                                                     |
| Config  | Added `.claude/settings.local.json` to `.gitignore` so machine-local permissions stay out of the repo                                           |
| Code    | Added `R/run_pti_pipeline.R` exporting `run_pti_pipeline()` — Shiny-free orchestrator for the seven-step calc pipeline (issue #10 deliverable 1) |
| Tests   | Added `tests/testthat/helper-test-data.R` providing bundled data plus deterministic pipeline intermediates for Tier-1 tests                     |
| Tests   | Added `tests/testthat/test-calc-pipeline.R` — first batch of Tier-1 cases for `get_mt`/`get_adm_levels`/`clean_geoms`/`pivot_pti_dta`/`get_weighted_data`/`get_scores_data` plus end-to-end via `run_pti_pipeline()`, pinning the lexicographic-sort and 1-row-NA quirks per arch-03 |
| Config  | Regenerated `NAMESPACE` to export `run_pti_pipeline`; bumped `RoxygenNote` to 7.3.3 as a side-effect of `roxygen2::roxygenise()`                |
| Tests   | Extended `helper-test-data.R` with `test_expanded` and `test_merged` so downstream Tier-1 tests don't each rebuild the expand/merge pipeline    |
| Tests   | Added Level A.7 + A.8 cases to `test-calc-pipeline.R` covering `expand_adm_levels` and `merge_expandedn_adm_levels`; pins the >1-element-match short-circuit and the missing-`year` error per arch-02.01 |
| Tests   | Extended `helper-test-data.R` with `test_extrap` (multi-scheme expand+merge) and `test_aggregated` so A.10/A.11 don't each rebuild the chain  |
| Tests   | Added Level A.9 cases to `test-calc-pipeline.R` covering `agg_pti_scores` — output shape, scheme row-binding, spatial_name lookup, NA propagation under both `na_rm_pti2 = FALSE/TRUE`, all-NA-row zero-sum behaviour, and NA-Pcod row dropping |
| Tests   | Added Level A.10 cases (`label_generic_pti` + `generic_pti_glue`) covering glue-class output, HTML structure, NA -> "No data" rendering, 5-decimal score formatting, and list-shape preservation |
| Tests   | Added Level A.11 cases (`structure_pti_data`) covering output slots, `pti_codes` mapping, wide pivot to `pti_score..pti_ind_N`, row-count-preserving geometry join, the synthetic "No data" filler for missing (Pcod, scheme) combos, and admin_level extraction from shape list names |
| Tests   | Added Level B integration tests — one per adjacent-stage pair (pivot->weight->score->expand->merge->agg->label->structure) so contracts between stages are pinned in addition to the orchestrator-level checks |
| Tooling | Added "PLAN.md Sync (COMPULSORY)" section to `.claude/CLAUDE.md` — every PR that touches tracked work updates `PLAN.md` in the same commit                                                            |
| Tooling | Added a final "Sync `PLAN.md`" step to the `tdd-permanent-fn`, `cleanup-batch`, and `roxygen-document` skills so tick-off is part of the workflow, not an afterthought                                |
| Docs    | Synced `PLAN.md`: marked 1a-1c complete, expanded 1e with a per-file checklist, resolved §3.1 and §3.2 (branch + skills shipped), pruned answered §9 questions, added a §11 "Progress log" of merged PRs |
| Tests   | Added `tests/testthat/test-validators.R` (1e bullet 1) — Tier-1 tests for `validate_single_geom`, `validate_geometries`, `validate_read_shp`, `validate_read_metadata`, `validate_metadata`. Includes a `capture_validator()` helper that mocks the validators' internal `testthat::test_that` calls so their inner expectation failures don't pollute the outer suite; pins the pre-existing empty-pattern `str_detect` bug in `validate_read_shp` (refactor will land via #7) |
| Docs    | `PLAN.md` ticked the validators item under §4.1 1e and logged PR #20 in §11; suite total updated to 450 expectations |
| Tests   | Added `tests/testthat/test-template-reader.R` (1e bullet 2) — covers `fct_template_reader` (sheet structure, fltr_* logical coercion, NULL `weights_clean` when no `weights_table` sheet, var_code filtering), `fct_convert_weight_to_clean` (synthetic `wsN..*` columns), `get_shape` (all three branches), and `create_new_pti` (template scaffolding into a tempdir with `open = FALSE` and stdout silenced) |
| Docs    | `PLAN.md` ticked template-reader under §4.1 1e and logged PR #21 in §11; suite total updated to 478 expectations |
| Tests   | Added `tests/testthat/test-indicators-list.R` (1e bullet 3) — covers `get_indicators_list` happy path, column schema, var_code uniqueness, nested `admin_levels_years` shape, the `fltr_exclude_pti` filter, alternative `fltr_var` arg, and a PINNED error on a non-existent fltr_var |
| Tests   | Removed legacy placeholder `tests/testthat/test-get_indicators_list.R` (a 6-line tautology `expect_gt(2*2, 3)`) — superseded by the new `test-indicators-list.R` |
| Docs    | `PLAN.md` ticked indicators-list under §4.1 1e and logged PR #22 in §11; suite total updated to 507 expectations |
| Tests   | Added `tests/testthat/test-drop-inval-adm.R` (1e bullet 4) — covers `get_vars_un_avbil` (output shape + explicit admin_levels arg), `get_min_admin_wght` (zero-weight / fully-available / weighting-an-unavailable-var / multi-scheme), and `drop_inval_adm` (empty drops, scheme+admin match, drop-everything) |
| Docs    | `PLAN.md` ticked drop-inval-adm under §4.1 1e and logged PR #23 in §11; suite total updated to 523 expectations |
